     import torch
     import torch.nn as nn
     import torch.optim as optim
     from torchvision import datasets, transforms
     from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
     ```

     transform = transforms.Compose([
         transforms.ToTensor(),
         transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))
     ])

     # Download and load the training data
     train_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
     train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
     ```
  3. **Define the Neural Network:**

     class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
         def __init__(self):
             super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
             self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28*28, 128)
             self.relu = nn.ReLU()
             self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

         def forward(self, x):
             x = x.view(-1, 28*28)  # Flatten the input
             x = self.fc1(x)
             x = self.relu(x)
             x = self.fc2(x)
             return x
     ```
  4. **Initialize Model, Loss Function, and Optimizer:**
     ```python
     model = SimpleNN()
     criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
     optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
     ```
  5. **Training Loop with Enhanced Logging:**
     ```python
     num_epochs = 5
     for epoch in range(num_epochs):
         running_loss = 0.0
         for batch_idx, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
             optimizer.zero_grad()
             outputs = model(images)
             loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
             loss.backward()
             optimizer.step()

             running_loss += loss.item()
             if (batch_idx + 1) % 100 == 0:
                 print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Step [{batch_idx+1}/{len(train_loader)}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

         epoch_loss = running_loss / len(train_loader)
         print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}] Completed with Average Loss: {epoch_loss:.4f}')

     print("Training complete.")
     ```
  6. **Evaluation on Test Data:**
     ```python
     # Load test data
     test_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)
     test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=1000, shuffle=False)

     # Evaluation
     model.eval()  # Set model to evaluation mode
     correct = 0
     total = 0
     with torch.no_grad():
         for images, labels in test_loader:
             outputs = model(images)
             _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
             total += labels.size(0)
             correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

  - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Modify learning rates, batch sizes, or optimizer settings to observe their impact on training.
  - **Visualization:** Plot loss curves and accuracy metrics to visualize training progress.

##### **4.4. Exploring PyTorch's Computational Graph and Autograd**
- **Understanding Autograd Mechanics:**
  - **Dynamic Graph Construction:** Each operation creates a node in the computational graph, allowing for flexibility in model architectures.
  - **Gradient Tracking:** Only tensors with `requires_grad=True` are tracked for gradient computation.
  - **Backward Pass:** Initiated by calling `.backward()` on the loss tensor, propagating gradients backward through the graph.
- **Practical Example: Gradient Computation**
  ```python
  # Create tensors
  x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
  y = x**2 + 3*x + 1

  # Compute gradients
  y.backward()

  # Access gradient
  print(x.grad)  # Output: tensor(7.0)
  ```
- **Custom Gradient Computation:**
  - **Implementing Custom Autograd Function:**
    ```python
    class MySquare(torch.autograd.Function):
        @staticmethod
        def forward(ctx, input):
            ctx.save_for_backward(input)
            return input * input

        @staticmethod
        def backward(ctx, grad_output):
            input, = ctx.saved_tensors
            grad_input = grad_output * 2 * input
            return grad_input

    # Usage
    x = torch.tensor(3.0, requires_grad=True)
    y = MySquare.apply(x)
    y.backward()
    print(x.grad)  # Output: tensor(6.0)
    ```
  - **Benefits:** Allows for custom operations where built-in functions may not suffice, enabling experimentation with novel activation functions or layers.
- **Advanced Topics:**
  - **Higher-Order Gradients:** Computing gradients of gradients for complex optimization tasks.
  - **Non-Scalar Outputs:** Handling situations where the output is not a single scalar value, requiring specifying gradient arguments.
  - **In-Place Operations:** Understanding how in-place modifications affect the computational graph and gradient computations.

##### **4.5. Optimizing PyTorch Environment for Development**
- **Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks:**
  - **Installation:**
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```
  - **Launching JupyterLab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
  - **Integrating PyTorch:**
    - **Kernel Selection:** Ensure that the Jupyter kernel is using the correct virtual environment with PyTorch installed.
    - **Magic Commands for GPU:**
      ```python
      # Check GPU availability
      %env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
      ```
  - **Useful Extensions:**
    - **TensorBoard Integration:**
      ```python
      %load_ext tensorboard
      import torch
      from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

      writer = SummaryWriter()
      # Log a scalar value
      writer.add_scalar('Loss/train', loss.item(), epoch)
      writer.close()
      ```
    - **Interactive Widgets:** Utilize `ipywidgets` for interactive parameter tuning and visualizations.
- **Version Control with Git:**
  - **Initializing a Repository:**
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
  - **Best Practices:**
    - **Atomic Commits:** Make small, focused commits with clear messages.
    - **Branching Strategy:** Use branches for features, bug fixes, and experiments to maintain a clean main branch.
    - **Example `.gitignore` for Python and PyTorch Projects:**
      ```
      # Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
      __pycache__/
      *.py[cod]
