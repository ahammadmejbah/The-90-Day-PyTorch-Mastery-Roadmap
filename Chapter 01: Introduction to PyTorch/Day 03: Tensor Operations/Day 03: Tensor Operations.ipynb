    "## 9. Advanced Tips and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leverage GPU Acceleration:**\n",
    "    - **Move Tensors to GPU:**\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        if torch.cuda.is_available():\n",
    "            device = torch.device('cuda')\n",
    "            x = x.to(device)\n",

    "            print(z.device)  # Output: cuda:0\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - **Ensure All Tensors Are on the Same Device:** Prevent runtime errors by maintaining consistency in tensor devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient Memory Management:**\n",
    "    - **Use In-Place Operations Sparingly:** While they save memory, they can complicate the computational graph.\n",
    "    - **Detach Tensors When Necessary:**\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        y = z.detach()\n",
    "        ```\n",

    "3. **Avoid Common Pitfalls:**\n",
    "    - **Understand Broadcasting Rules:** Ensure tensor dimensions are compatible to avoid unexpected results.\n",
    "    - **Manage Gradient Tracking:** Be cautious with `requires_grad=True` to manage which tensors should track gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize Performance:**\n",
    "    - **Batch Operations:** Perform operations on batches of data to leverage parallel computation.\n",
    "    - **Minimize Data Transfers:** Reduce the number of times tensors are moved between CPU and GPU to enhance performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Readability and Maintenance:**\n",
    "    - **Use Descriptive Variable Names:** Enhance code clarity by naming tensors meaningfully.\n",
    "    - **Modularize Code:** Break down complex operations into smaller, reusable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Integrate with Other Libraries:**\n",
    "    - **Seamless Conversion Between PyTorch and NumPy:**\n",
    "        ```python\n",

    "        tensor_from_df = torch.tensor(df.values).to(device)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Utilize Built-in Functions:**\n",
    "    - **Aggregation Functions:** `torch.sum`, `torch.mean`, `torch.max`, etc.\n",
    "    - **Statistical Operations:** `torch.std`, `torch.var`, etc.\n",

    "**Q1: What is the difference between in-place (`add_()`) and out-of-place (`add()`) operations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A1:** \n",
    "- **Out-of-Place Operations (`add()`):** These create a new tensor without modifying the original tensors.\n",

    "    x.add_(5)  # x is modified to [6, 7, 8]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Can in-place operations interfere with gradient computations in autograd?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A2:** Yes. In-place operations can overwrite values required for gradient computations, leading to errors during backpropagation. It's essential to use in-place operations cautiously, especially with tensors that have `requires_grad=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: How does broadcasting work in PyTorch?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A3:** Broadcasting allows PyTorch to perform operations on tensors of different shapes by automatically expanding the smaller tensor to match the larger tensor's shape. The dimensions must be compatible, following specific rules:\n",
    "- If the tensors have different numbers of dimensions, prepend the smaller tensor's shape with ones until both shapes have the same length.\n",
    "- For each dimension, the sizes must either be equal or one of them must be one.\n",

    "\n",
    "Broadcasting is a powerful feature that allows PyTorch to perform operations on tensors of different shapes efficiently. Here's a more detailed look:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Broadcasting Rules:**\n",
    "1. **Starting from the trailing dimensions (i.e., rightmost), compare the size of each dimension between the two tensors.\n",
    "2. **If the dimensions are equal, or one of them is 1, the tensors are compatible for broadcasting.\n",
    "3. **If the tensors have different numbers of dimensions, prepend the shape of the smaller tensor with ones until both shapes have the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tensor A: shape (3, 1)\n",

    "#         [7., 8., 9., 10.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- Tensor A is reshaped to (3, 4) by repeating its single column across four columns.\n",
    "- Tensor B is reshaped to (3, 4) by repeating its single row across three rows.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q1: Why do some tensor operations require tensors to be of the same shape?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A1:** Element-wise operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division require tensors to have the same shape to ensure that each corresponding element is operated upon correctly. When tensors have different shapes, broadcasting rules are applied to make their shapes compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: What is the significance of the underscore (`_`) in in-place operations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A2:** In PyTorch, methods that perform in-place operations have an underscore (`_`) suffix. This convention indicates that the operation will modify the tensor in place, altering its data directly rather than creating a new tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: Can in-place operations affect the computation graph used for autograd?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A3:** Yes. In-place operations can overwrite values that are required to compute gradients during backpropagation, leading to errors. It's essential to use in-place operations cautiously, especially with tensors that have `requires_grad=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: How does PyTorch handle operations on tensors with different data types?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A4:** PyTorch performs automatic type casting based on a hierarchy of data types. If tensors have different data types, PyTorch will upcast to the higher precision type to prevent loss of information. However, it's good practice to ensure tensors have the same data type before performing operations to avoid unexpected behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5: What happens if I try to add tensors with incompatible shapes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A5:** PyTorch will raise a `RuntimeError` indicating that the shapes are not compatible for broadcasting. To resolve this, ensure that the tensor shapes adhere to broadcasting rules or manually reshape the tensors to compatible shapes.\n",
