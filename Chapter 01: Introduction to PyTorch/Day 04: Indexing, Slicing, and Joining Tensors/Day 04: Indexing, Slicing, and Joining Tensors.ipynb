    "## 1. Topics Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Indexing and Slicing Tensors**\n",
    "Indexing and slicing are fundamental operations that allow you to access and manipulate specific elements or sub-tensors within a larger tensor. These operations are analogous to indexing and slicing in Python lists and NumPy arrays but come with additional capabilities tailored for deep learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Joining and Splitting Tensors**\n",
    "Joining tensors involves combining multiple tensors into a single tensor, while splitting tensors refers to dividing a tensor into smaller tensors. These operations are essential for tasks such as batch processing, data augmentation, and preparing inputs for neural network layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 2. Indexing and Slicing Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Basic Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Basic indexing allows you to access individual elements or subsets of elements within a tensor using their indices."
